SusySkim_LeptonTrackSelector/ contains portions of SusySkim code that I use to store lepton and track variables.
Scripts/convert.py converts from ROOT to a pickled list that I can work with in Python.
Scripts/features.py contains currently used lepton and track variable names.
Scripts/compare.py makes plots of features compared between prompt and HF leptons. It also compares calculated and stored ptcone features.
