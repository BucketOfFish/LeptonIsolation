The ROOTToH5 package takes a ROOT file, extracts lepton and track data, and saves the result as a H5 file.
It has to be run on lxplus due to the relevant CERN-related libraries.

Refinery is in charge of taking this H5 file, grouping leptons and tracks, adding various features, and outputting a pkl file that is useable by our training framework.

I'm not very happy about using pkl format, or about having to split data prep functionality across two packages, but I haven't found a way to solve these problems yet.
